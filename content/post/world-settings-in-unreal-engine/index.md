Each Level can have unique settings applied to it from the World Settings panel. You can use this panel to do everthing from making sure the right Game Mode is activated when you play the Level to adjusting how global illumination works for that Level.

To open the World Settings panel, from the main menu, go to Window, then select World Settings.
